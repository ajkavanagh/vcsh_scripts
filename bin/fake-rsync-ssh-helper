# helper to use rsync with lxd

# 1. Store the first argument provided by rsync (target name) in the ctn variable
# 2. Shift all arguments by 1 (effectively dropping the argument we just stored)
# 3. Exec “lxc exec” for the container name we stored earlier and passing in all the remaining arguments as the command to execute in the container
